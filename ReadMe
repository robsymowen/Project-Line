OVERVIEW

In this notebook, we run an experiment that trains an untrained AlexNet model on line-drawing versions of the ImageNet dataset.
We hypothesize that the training dataset would steer the model toward human-like shape bias in its feature selection and classification of images.
We asses the models using Representational Similarity Matrices that employ Pearson similarity scores.

INSTRUCTIONS
1. Run the conversion notebook, setting an input and output directory at the top
2. Run the training notebook, also setting an input and output directory.
3. Run the analysis notebook




First run conversions
Then run training
Then run analysis
